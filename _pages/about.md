## Bio
I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Data Science, Universitas Negeri Surabaya (*State University of Surabaya*), Indonesia. I received M.Sc. degree from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taiwan in 2013 and Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Coventry University, U.K. in 2024. 

My main research interests are network-enabled systems for underlying data-driven solutions, encompassing distributed computing and machine learning. I have served as a chair for the Technical Programme Committee at several leading international conferences. I have been frequently invited to review articles in prestigious journals and conferences.
